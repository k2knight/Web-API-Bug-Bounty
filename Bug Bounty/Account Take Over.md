# Account Take Over

can we register as `my%00email@email.com` but it is taking as `myemail@email.com` then we can register with that and ATO.
Same with the username.

 If you sign up with` my%00email@email.com,` the backend might store this as my. If my is already a valid username or email in the system, you might be able to take over that account.
